# ðŸ“š Multi Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains four different deep learning projects implemented using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other modern libraries. Each project addresses a unique problem in the deep learning domain and includes detailed code, experiments, and results.

# ðŸ”¥ Projects Included
## 1. Creating Multi-Task Models
Description:
Developed models that can learn and predict multiple outputs at once (e.g., predicting different attributes of the same input). It demonstrates shared representation learning using PyTorch.

## 2. Tweet Emotion Recognition
Description:
Built a deep learning pipeline to classify tweets into emotion categories like happy, angry, sad, etc. The project includes preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## 3. Object Localization with PyTorch
Description:
Implemented a model that not only classifies objects but also predicts their bounding box locations inside images. It uses a combination of regression and classification heads.

## 4. Customer Churn Prediction using RNN, LSTM, and GRU
Description:
Implemented deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) using TensorFlow to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data.

Preprocessing involved label encoding, scaling, and reshaping for sequence models.

Each model used stacked layers with BatchNorm and Dropout for stability and regularization.

Evaluation included accuracy, precision-recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

LSTM performed the best, offering the highest accuracy and AUC score for predicting churn.

# ðŸ“š Multi Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains three different deep learning projects implemented using PyTorch and other modern libraries:

## Multi-Task Models: Building models capable of performing multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Tweet Emotion Recognition: Classifying emotions from short social media text posts.

## Object Localization: Detecting and localizing objects within an image using deep learning.

Each project explores different challenges in deep learning, providing detailed code, experiments, and results.

##ðŸ”¥ Projects Included
### 1. Creating Multi-Task Models
Description:
Developed models that can learn and predict multiple outputs at once (e.g., predicting different attributes of the same input). It demonstrates shared representation learning using PyTorch.

### 2. Tweet Emotion Recognition
Description:
Built a deep learning pipeline to classify tweets into emotion categories like happy, angry, sad, etc. The project includes preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

### 3. Object Localization with PyTorch
Description:
Implemented a model that not only classifies objects but also predicts their bounding box locations inside images. It uses a combination of regression and classification heads.
